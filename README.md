# Gigastore SDK Example App Android

This example project embeds the Gigastore SDK and presents its functionality in a simple way.

##  Requirements
Please note that the application needs to be signed so that the eSIM installation can work. The fingerprint of the keystore file needs to be shared with us so we can setup everything. This process can take some time.
If you already shared a fingerprint with us, it might make sense to sign the application with that same keystore file to test this app.
